				<div class="entry-content"> <p>Hello. I'm Daniel and I work at Square as a Software Engineer focusing on data pipelines and architectures. Previously I worked at Weebly (acquired by Square) doing backend development, and prior to tech companies, I developed and maintained news alerts and APIs for The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>I probably have spent much more time coding than blogging or updating my website so <a href="https://github.com/dazhaoniel">my GitHub</a> contains more recent projects.</p> </div>

				<div class="entry-content"> <p>Heroku and Google Cloud are my choices for personal project hosting, and Python is my favorite scripting language. This is because of its elegance, and the fact that I don't have to deal with brackets and semicolons. I also have working knowledge of JavaScript, some Node.js based frameworks and NoSQL databases. I'm always thinking about new project ideas and how to put my knowledge into good practice.</p>
<p>I’ve worked on developing WordPress themes and plugins since undergrad, which has given me significant experience in that area. If you have a non profit website, and need some help updating or fixing bugs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to provide my skills pro bono for a good cause.</p> </div>

				<div class="entry-content"> <p><a href="https://www.aapibusiness.co/">AAPI Business Collective</a></p>
<p>AAPI Business Collective is a directory for businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Since the start of Covid-19 pandemic, businesses owned by AAPI have been heavily impacted due to economic hardships, fear and racism. My friend Ada and I created AAPI Business Collective to be a platform for promoting and supporting AAPI businesses, and to be a common space for customers looking to shop at AAPI businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/pilot-fish/">Pilot Fish</a></p>
<p>Voted as one of the 40 Best Free Responsive WordPress Themes for 2012, Pilot Fish is a minimal and elegant WordPress portfolio theme. It is inspired by the novel <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5_%28%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AC%29">『パイロットフィッシュ』(by Osaki Yoshio)</a> I read while living in Sendai, Japan. It is said that a pilot fish is the fish you keep in the fish tank before a tropical fish, so as to develop a sustainable environment for which to thrive later. I called my first WordPress theme Pilot Fish hoping it would help me learn more about WordPress, and contribute to better themes in the future.</p> </div>
