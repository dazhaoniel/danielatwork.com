				<div class="entry-content"> <p>Hello. I'm Daniel and I work at Square as a Software Engineer focusing on data pipelines and architectures. Previously I worked at Weebly (acquired by Square) doing backend development, and before that, I developed and maintained news alerts and APIs for The Wall Street Journal. I recieved both Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering from <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>.</p>
<p>I probably have spent much more time coding than blogging or updating my website so <a href="https://github.com/dazhaoniel">my GitHub</a> contains more recent projects.</p> </div>

				<div class="entry-content"> <p>When I write code I usually do it in Python, but I've been using few different languages since I started working professionally about a decade ago. Most of what I've been doing last few years has been data engineering, and backend development. Google Cloud is my choice for personal project hosting, but at work everything is on AWS.</p>
<p>I’ve worked on developing WordPress themes and plugins since undergrad, which has given me significant experience in that area. If you have a non profit website, and need some help updating or fixing bugs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to provide my skills pro bono for a good cause.</p> </div>

				<div class="entry-content"> <p>Here are some projects from my hobbies. FYI, there are some projects not listed because they are in early stage development, or not ready to showcase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aapibusiness.co/">AAPI Business Collective</a></p>
<p>AAPI Business Collective is a directory for businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Since the start of Covid-19 pandemic, businesses owned by AAPI have been heavily impacted due to economic hardships, fear and racism. My friend Ada and I created AAPI Business Collective to be a platform for promoting and supporting AAPI businesses, and to be a common space for customers looking to shop at AAPI businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/pilot-fish/">Pilot Fish</a></p>
<p>Voted as one of the 40 Best Free Responsive WordPress Themes for 2012, Pilot Fish is a minimal and elegant WordPress portfolio theme. It is inspired by the novel <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5_%28%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AC%29">『パイロットフィッシュ』(by Osaki Yoshio)</a> I read while living in Sendai, Japan. It is said that a pilot fish is the fish you keep in the fish tank before a tropical fish, so as to develop a sustainable environment for which to thrive later. I called my first WordPress theme Pilot Fish hoping it would help me learn more about WordPress, and contribute to better themes in the future.</p> </div>
