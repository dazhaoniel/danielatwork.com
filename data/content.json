			"name":"Pilot Fish WordPress Theme",
			"description": "Voted as one of the **40 Best Free Responsive WordPress Themes** for 2012, Pilot Fish is a minimal and elegant WordPress portfolio theme. It is inspired by the novel 『パイロットフィッシュ』(by Osaki Yoshio) I read while living in Sendai, Japan. It is said that a pilot fish is the fish you keep in the fish tank before a tropical fish, so as to develop a sustainable environment for which to thrive later. I called my first WordPress theme Pilot Fish hoping it would help me learn more about WordPress, and contribute to better themes in the future.",
