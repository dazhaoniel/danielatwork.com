# Introduction

This is a simple static one page website built with Flask and hosted on [BlueHost](https://bluehost.com).

I built it for [danielatwork.com](http://danielatwork.com), but it can be used to power any static pages and can serve as a useful template for starting a one page portfolio site with static media (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc).
