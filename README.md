Daniel Zhao - Portfolio
=======================

# Introduction

This is a simple static page built with Flask and hosted on [BlueHost](https://bluehost.com). It displays:

* Featured Projects
* Recent posts from a feed URL

I built it for [danielatwork.com](http://danielatwork.com), but it can be used to power any static pages and can serve as a useful template for starting a portfolio site with static media (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc).

# Dependencies

1. Flask: `pip install Flask`

# HTML Template

The HTML Template is from [Read Only by HTML5 Up](http://html5up.net/read-only)

# Site
