        <p>Hello. I'm Daniel and I work at <a href="http://www.dowjones.com" target="_blank">Dow Jones</a> as an Application Developer, where I work on <a href="http://www.wsj.com/pro/" target="_blank">WSJ Pro</a>, blogs and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/newsletters" target="_blank">newsletters</a>. On the weekends, I like distance running, movies, eating out, coding personal projects, practicing handstands and shopping. Before New York City, I lived in Upstate New York and Japan. I was born and raised in China.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I have been working on my latest project <a href="http://1kgmore.org" target="_blank">1KG More</a> â€” a website built exclusively for nonprofit organizations that want to minimize operating cost. 1KG More allows nonprofit organizations to post project destinations, along with a list of items that could be used or are needed for the project. Travelers who happen to travel to the same destination can sign up and choose how much and what they are willing to carry (for the organization), starting at 1kg.</p>
        <p>1KG More was born because I want to do more when I travel. I always wanted to carry school supplies to fill in the extra space in my luggage.</p>
        <p>And I believe everyone has something to contribute in their spare time.</p>
