Hello. I'm Daniel and I work at Square as a Software Engineer focusing on data pipelines and architectures. Previously I worked at Weebly (acquired by Square) doing backend development, and before that, I developed and maintained news alerts and APIs for The Wall Street Journal. I recieved both Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/).

I probably have spent much more time coding than blogging or updating my website so [my GitHub](https://github.com/dazhaoniel) contains more recent projects.
