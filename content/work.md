Heroku and Google Cloud are my choices for personal project hosting, and Python is my favorite scripting language. This is because of its elegance, and the fact that I don't have to deal with brackets and semicolons. I also have working knowledge of JavaScript, some Node.js based frameworks and NoSQL databases. I'm always thinking about new project ideas and how to put my knowledge into good practice.

I’ve worked on developing WordPress themes and plugins since undergrad, which has given me significant experience in that area. If you have a non profit website, and need some help updating or fixing bugs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to provide my skills pro bono for a good cause.
