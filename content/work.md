When I write code I usually do it in Python, but I've been using few different languages since I started working professionally about a decade ago. Most of what I've been doing last few years has been data engineering, and backend development. Google Cloud is my choice for personal project hosting, but at work everything is on AWS.

I’ve worked on developing WordPress themes and plugins since undergrad, which has given me significant experience in that area. If you have a non profit website, and need some help updating or fixing bugs, please feel free to reach out to me. I’m happy to provide my skills pro bono for a good cause.
