What about stuff outside of work? Some misc facts about me:

- I moved to New York City after I graduated from college. Before NYC, I lived in Upstate New York and Japan.
- I have a dog named [Franki](https://www.instagram.com/franki_lowrider/).
- I speak English, Spanish, and Chinese. I also know some Japanese and Arabic (FusHa), and I've been studying French with Alliance Fran√ßaise since 2022.
- I became vegan in 2017.
- I love running, hiking, cycling and scuba diving.
- I'm a volunteer delivery driver for a NYC mobile soup kitchen - [Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/) since 2018. My favorite route is Uptown where in summer I get to catch the sunset at St. John the Divine around 8pm while handing out food.
