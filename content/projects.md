[AAPI Business Collective](https://www.aapibusiness.co/)

AAPI Business Collective is a directory for businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Since the start of Covid-19 pandemic, businesses owned by AAPI have been heavily impacted due to economic hardships, fear and racism. My friend Ada and I created AAPI Business Collective to be a platform for promoting and supporting AAPI businesses, and to be a common space for customers looking to shop at AAPI businesses.

[Pilot Fish](https://wordpress.org/themes/pilot-fish/)

Voted as one of the 40 Best Free Responsive WordPress Themes for 2012, Pilot Fish is a minimal and elegant WordPress portfolio theme. It is inspired by the novel [『パイロットフィッシュ』(by Osaki Yoshio)](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5_%28%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AC%29) I read while living in Sendai, Japan. It is said that a pilot fish is the fish you keep in the fish tank before a tropical fish, so as to develop a sustainable environment for which to thrive later. I called my first WordPress theme Pilot Fish hoping it would help me learn more about WordPress, and contribute to better themes in the future.
